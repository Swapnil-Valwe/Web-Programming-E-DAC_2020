        <em>Cover me, oh!</em>

        I can't believe how much I hate
        Pressures of a new place roll my way
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
        I crumble underneath the weight
        Pressures of a new place roll my way
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
        
        Spirits in my room, friend or foe?
        Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
        Dusting off my jumpsuit
        <em style="color:aqua ">(Cover me)</em>
        
        I can't believe how much I hate <em style="color:palevioletred">(Cover me, oh)</em>
        Pressures of a new place roll my way <em style="color:palevioletred">(Cover me, oh)</em>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me <em style="color:palevioletred">(Cover me, oh)</em>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me <em style="color:palevioletred">(Cover me, oh)</em>
        
        I'll be right there
        But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
        If you need anyone
        I'll stop my plans <em style="color:lightseagreen">(I'll stop my plans)</em>
        But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
        If you need anyone
        I'll be right there
        But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
        <em style="color:darkseagreen">(If you need anyone)</em>
        If you need anyone <em style="color:darkseagreen">(If you need anyone)</em>
        If you need anyone <em style="color:darkseagreen">(If you need anyone)</em>
        If you need anyone
        
        I can't believe how much I hate
        Pressures of a new place roll my way
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
        Oh, jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me, oh!
        
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
